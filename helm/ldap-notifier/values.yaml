  # "Always" => Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to

  #             locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet pulls the image with the resolved
  #             digest, and uses that image to launch the container.

  #            kubelet attempts to start the container; otherwise, startup fails.

  # "ClusterIP" => Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable
  #                from within the cluster. This is the default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a type for
  #                a Service.
  # "NodePort" => Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port
  #               available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of
  #               type: ClusterIP.
  # "LoadBalancer" => Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
  #
